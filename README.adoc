Based on the fine work of https://github.com/maverickvector[maverickvector] in https://github.com/maverickvector/SVGility-Gallery-Script[SVGility-Gallery-Script]. This is a static gallery for SVG images implemented in javascript with a Python script intended to be implemented server side to refresh the page as required.
