= SVG Library

Based on the fine work of https://github.com/maverickvector[maverickvector] in https://github.com/maverickvector/SVGility-Gallery-Script[SVGility-Gallery-Script]. This is a static gallery for SVG images implemented in javascript with a Python script intended to be implemented server side to refresh the page as required.

== Installation

* Requires Python 2.7.
* `pip install jinja2 watchdog`
* Simply open the `svgility.html` in the base directory
* Probably nothing is rendered unless an image is moved in the `images` directory off the base directory.
